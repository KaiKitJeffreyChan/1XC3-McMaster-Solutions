Bonus --------------

To first start I made two txt files (file1.txt and file2.txt) in the same directory (touch) and edited them with 
a slight difference (vi). Then I used the command 

diff file1.txt file2.txt 

to compare them both. The contents within file1 was "Hi i am banana" and file2 "Hi i am apple"

the following command would return this 


1c1
< Hi i am banana
---
> Hi i am apple

each different is listed in turn in a single column, each difference is labeled 
These labels contain special numbers and characters like 1c1 the first number is the line number in file1.txt
and second number is line in file2.txt the letter in the middle may also vary.

c - you need to change a certain line

a - you need to add something 

d - you need to delete something
